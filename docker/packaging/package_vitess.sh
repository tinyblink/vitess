description='A database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL

Vitess is a database solution for deploying, scaling and managing large
clusters of MySQL instances. Itâ€™s architected to run as effectively in a public
or private cloud architecture as it does on dedicated hardware. It combines and
extends many important MySQL features with the scalability of a NoSQL database.'
